--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit
and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are
12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.
