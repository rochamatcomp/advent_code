Advent of Code - 2023

--- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---

On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the first digit
and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit number.

For example:
1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are
12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

--- Part Two ---

It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters:
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also
count as valid "digits".

two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are
29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.
